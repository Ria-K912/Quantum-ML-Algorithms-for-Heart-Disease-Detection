# Quantum-ML-Algorithms-for-Heart-Disease-Detection
In this project, I have used two Quantum Machine Learning Algorithms - 
a) Callable Kernel QSVM 
b) VQC
I have used the Cleveland Dataset and applied the above algorithms. 
Even though the accuracy was lesser of the above two algorithms in comparison to the classical counterparts. However, in terms of time complexity, VQC was taking less time to train compared to the classical algorithms with a slight reduction in accuracy.
